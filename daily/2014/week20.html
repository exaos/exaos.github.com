It's nice to be tall, right? Sure, it's great&#x2026; unless you want to become an
astronaut, or a horse jockey, or an old man.
</p>

<p>
Ok, I'm joking on the last point. But a new study found an inverse link between
height and longevity, finding that shorter men are more likely to live longer.
</p>

<p>
The study concerned a group 8,006 Japanese-American men in Oahu, Hawaii, who
scientists have kept tabs on for more than 40 years. These men were born between
1900 and 1916 and are "genetically and culturally homogeneous," allowing
researchers to make some interesting findings they wouldn't be able to ferret
out in a more diverse group.
</p>


<p>
长得高很棒，对不对？当然喽……除非你想当宇航员，或者赛马骑师，或者一名老人。最后一个是玩笑，不过最新的一项研究 (<a href="10.1371/journal.pone.0094385">10.1371/journal.pone.0094385</a>) 表明矮人似乎更长寿些。在这项研究中，科学家耗费 40 年跟踪了夏威夷欧服岛上一个 8006 人的日本裔美国人群体。这些人出生于 1900 至 1916 年前，在基因和文化上都很纯粹，从而让研究者能够获得其它群体中无法找到的一些有趣的发现。
</p>


<p>
<b>The gene's effect on longevity may relate to its role in regulating insulin.</b>
</p>

<p>
They found that shorter men were more likely to have a protective version of the
gene FOXO3, which previous research has linked to a long life. This gene is
involved in insulin signaling (which is vital for metabolism), suppressing
tumors, and protecting cells from oxidative stress. It is also linked with
shorter stature and body-size in other animals. "This study shows for the first
time, that body size is linked to this gene," University of Hawaii researcher
and study co-author Bradley Willcox said in a statement. "We knew that in animal
models of aging. We did not know that in humans."
</p>

<p>
As is often the case, though, the study raises more questions than answers. "The
biological reason for an association of shorter stature in humans with longevity
is not fully understood," the authors wrote in the study, published in PLOS
ONE. The best guess, though, is that the gene's effect on longevity partially
has to do with its indirect role in regulating insulin. People with the gene
tend to have lower fasting insulin levels, which is itself predictive of better
cardiovascular health, and a lower risk of dying.
</p>

<p>
This doesn't mean that any one tall person has a greater risk of keeling over at
any given minute. "No matter how tall you are, you can still live a healthy
lifestyle" to offset the effects of not having the protective FOXO3 genotype,
Willcox added.
</p>

<p>
以前的研究表明 FOXO3 基因与长寿相关联，而在这项研究中发现矮人的 FOXO3 基因保护得更加良好。 FOXO3 基因涉及到新陈代谢中的胰岛素信号、抑制肿瘤生长、保护细胞免受氧化压力等。该基因在其它动物中还与身材和体型大小相关。而这项研究首次表明该基因与人的体型大小有关。
</p>

<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>: <br  />
Height in mid-life is positively associated with mortality, with shorter stature
predicting longer lifespan. Height was, moreover, associated with fasting
insulin level and the longevity genotype of FOXO3, consistent with a mechanistic
role for the IIS pathway.
