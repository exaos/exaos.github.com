The Kraken debate, an Earthlike alien world and sugar a drug? These are the most
interesting stories we found in Science this week.

<p>
A 9,000-year-old painting of an exploding volcano, the oldest ever found, can
now be linked to a real-life eruption in Turkey.
</p>

<p>
The towering Hasan Dağ volcano erupted 8,970 years ago, plus or minus 640 years,
according to a new dating technique that analyzes zircon crystals in volcanic
rock, geochemist Axel Schmitt of the University of California, Los Angeles,
reported here today (Oct. 30) at the Geological Society of America's annual
meeting.

Talk about a creature feature: A bizarre boomerang-headed amphibian that
burrowed in a seasonal pond in what is now Texas often met its doom in the jaws
of a reptilian fin-backed mammalian ancestor, new fossils reveal.
</p>

<p>
These two weird critters were residents of the Permian period 298 million to 250
million years ago, before dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Dimetrodon, the
jaguar-size finback, looked like a lizard but was actually more closely related
to modern mammals. Diplocaulus, the boomerang-head, was a truly strange
amphibian with an impractically wide, bony skull.

One man's irrepressible body odor was the result of a bacterial infection of his
armpit hair, according to a new report of the case.
</p>

<p>
The 40-year-old man told his doctors he'd had armpit odor and "dirty" armpit
hair for the last four years.

<p>
The rotting flesh, the shuffling walk, the unintelligible groans — it's not hard to spot a zombie at a glance even among the most gruesome of Halloween monsters. But what's going on inside their brain?
</p>

<p>
Based on fictional accounts of the undead creatures' bizarre behavior, several prominent scientists have taken a crack at the mystery. Neuroscientists Bradley Voytek, of the University of California, San Diego, and Tim Verstynen, of Carnegie Mellon University, are both avid zombie fans. Back when they were in graduate school together, they would sit around watching zombie movies and got to thinking about what causes zombies to behave as they do.

<p>
Did a giant kraken troll the Triassic seas, crushing ichthyosaurs and arranging their bones into pleasing patterns?
</p>

<p>
It sounds like a Halloween tale, but researchers who first suggested the existence of this ancient sea monster in 2011 say they now have more evidence backing up their controversial theory. Not only have they discovered a second example of strangely arranged bones, they've found a fossil that appears to be the beak of an ancient squid or octopus.

<p>
A puzzling alien planet is the closest thing to an Earth twin in size and composition known beyond our solar system, though it's far too hot to support life, scientists say.
</p>

<p>
The exoplanet Kepler-78b, whose supertight orbit baffles astronomers, is just 20 percent wider and about 80 percent more massive than Earth, with a density nearly identical to that of our planet, two research teams report in separate papers published online today (Oct. 30) in the journal Nature.

<p>
Tail wagging could convey more meaning among dogs than previously thought.
</p>

<p>
Dogs have different emotional responses to their peers depending on the direction of a tail-wag, a new study found. Seeing a fellow dog swing its tail to the right keeps canines relaxed, while a wag to the left side of the dog's body seems to induce stress, the researchers say.

A tick sucking blood from a victim has been caught in action on video, in all
its gory glory.
</p>

<p>
The new tick-sucking video, described today (Oct. 29) in the journal Proceedings
of the Royal Society B, reveals for the first time the gruesome method that
ticks use to anchor to the skin and insert their bloodsucking machinery.

<h2 id="orgheadline9">Is sugar a drug?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline9">
<p>
Some studies claim to find that junk food is as addictive as drugs, but experts
say that what actually determines how addictive something is, and whether an
individual becomes addicted, is complex.
</p>

<p>
In the most recent headline-grabbing research, a study in rats found that a
brain region important for pleasure was activated more strongly when the animals
were exposed to Oreos compared to cocaine. A 2011 study found that the brains of
people with "food addiction" reacted to junk food the same way that the brains
of people with drug addictions react to drugs.

<h2 id="orgheadline10">Are women better at multitasking?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline10">
<p>
Anecdotal evidence has long supported the hypothesis that the fair sex is also the "do-a-bunch-of-things-at-the-same-time" sex. And now a study out of the U.K. helps to support the idea women are better at multitasking than men.
</p>

<p>
In a set of two experiments, psychologists at the University of Hertfordshire, the University of Glasgow and the University of Leeds pitted men against women to see if they could lend some scientific credibility to that commonly held belief that women are better than men at multitasking.
