                        A 9,000-year-old painting of an exploding volcano, the oldest ever found, can
                        now be linked to a real-life eruption in Turkey.

                        The towering Hasan Dağ volcano erupted 8,970 years ago, plus or minus 640 years,
                        according to a new dating technique that analyzes zircon crystals in volcanic
                        rock, geochemist Axel Schmitt of the University of California, Los Angeles,

                        Talk about a creature feature: A bizarre boomerang-headed amphibian that
                        burrowed in a seasonal pond in what is now Texas often met its doom in the jaws
                        of a reptilian fin-backed mammalian ancestor, new fossils reveal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These two weird critters were residents of the Permian period 298 million to 250
                        million years ago, before dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Dimetrodon, the
                        jaguar-size finback, looked like a lizard but was actually more closely related
                        to modern mammals. Diplocaulus, the boomerang-head, was a truly strange
                        amphibian with an impractically wide, bony skull.

                        The rotting flesh, the shuffling walk, the unintelligible groans — it's not hard to spot a zombie at a glance even among the most gruesome of Halloween monsters. But what's going on inside their brain?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Based on fictional accounts of the undead creatures' bizarre behavior, several prominent scientists have taken a crack at the mystery. Neuroscientists Bradley Voytek, of the University of California, San Diego, and Tim Verstynen, of Carnegie Mellon University, are both avid zombie fans. Back when they were in graduate school together, they would sit around watching zombie movies and got to thinking about what causes zombies to behave as they do.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It sounds like a Halloween tale, but researchers who first suggested the existence of this ancient sea monster in 2011 say they now have more evidence backing up their controversial theory. Not only have they discovered a second example of strangely arranged bones, they've found a fossil that appears to be the beak of an ancient squid or octopus.

                    <p>
                        The exoplanet Kepler-78b, whose supertight orbit baffles astronomers, is just 20 percent wider and about 80 percent more massive than Earth, with a density nearly identical to that of our planet, two research teams report in separate papers published online today (Oct. 30) in the journal Nature.

                        Tail wagging could convey more meaning among dogs than previously thought.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dogs have different emotional responses to their peers depending on the direction of a tail-wag, a new study found. Seeing a fellow dog swing its tail to the right keeps canines relaxed, while a wag to the left side of the dog's body seems to induce stress, the researchers say.

                        Some studies claim to find that junk food is as addictive as drugs, but experts
                        say that what actually determines how addictive something is, and whether an
                        individual becomes addicted, is complex.

                    <p>
                        In the most recent headline-grabbing research, a study in rats found that a
                        brain region important for pleasure was activated more strongly when the animals
                        were exposed to Oreos compared to cocaine. A 2011 study found that the brains of
                        people with "food addiction" reacted to junk food the same way that the brains
                        of people with drug addictions react to drugs.

                        Anecdotal evidence has long supported the hypothesis that the fair sex is also the "do-a-bunch-of-things-at-the-same-time" sex. And now a study out of the U.K. helps to support the idea women are better at multitasking than men.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In a set of two experiments, psychologists at the University of Hertfordshire, the University of Glasgow and the University of Leeds pitted men against women to see if they could lend some scientific credibility to that commonly held belief that women are better than men at multitasking.
