                    <p>
                        On June 4, meteorologists in Huntsville, Ala., noticed a "blob" on their radar
                        screen that looked like a strong thunderstorm, despite the fact the sun was
                        shining and not a drop of rain could be found within a few hundred miles. After
                        some sleuthing, and several wacky explanations, the scientists have identified
                        the culprit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Our operational meteorologist spotted it on radar immediately and initially
                        thought he was caught off-guard by a pop-up thunderstorm that wasn't in the
                        forecast," Matthew Havin, data services manager at weather technology company
                        Baron Services, told LiveScience in an email. "Soon after that point we had
                        numerous people from around Huntsville (and even other meteorologists from other
                        states) calling and e-mailing us trying to determine what was going on at the
                        time."

                    <p>
                        A 57-year-old woman in Italy who went to the doctor with inflamed sinuses and
                        facial pain had an unusual diagnosis: a dental implant in the sinus.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The woman had undergone oral surgery about two years before to place an implant
                        — a 2-centimeter long (0.79 inch) metal screw designed to hold in place a
                        replacement for a missing tooth — in her upper jaw. But surprisingly, an
                        inspection of her mouth revealed the implant was not there. Instead, the gums
                        covering the area of her missing tooth were healed, and her remaining teeth were
                        healthy.

                        A lead curse tablet, dating back around 1,700 years and likely written by a
                        magician, has been discovered in a collapsed Roman mansion in Jerusalem,
                        archaeologists report.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The mansion, which is being excavated by the Israel Antiquities Authority in the
                        Givati Parking Lot, is located in what is known as the "City of David," an area
                        that holds at least 6,000 years of human occupation. The mansion itself covers
                        at least 2,000 square meters (about half an acre) and contains two large open
                        courtyards adjacent to each other. It was in use between the late third century
                        and A.D. 363, when it was destroyed in a series of earthquakes on May 18 or 19.

                        The sting of the Arizona bark scorpion is so fierce that humans say the pain is
                        like being hit by a hammer. But the tiny grasshopper mouse shakes off the sting
                        like it's nothing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now, researchers have found for the mouse, the sting really is nothing. Instead
                        of causing pain, the scorpion venom blocks it, a fact that could lead to the
                        development of new pain-blocking drugs for people.

                        Trees may turn golden for reasons that have nothing to do with the onset of
                        autumn: Eucalyptus trees can hold grains of gold, potentially helping reveal
                        buried treasure, scientists now find.

                    <p>
                        Many plants root deep into the Earth, drawing up nutrients and minerals they
                        need for life. Researchers hope this fact could one day help miners unearth
                        gold, especially since discoveries of new deposits of the precious metal have
                        dropped 45 percent over the last 10 years.

                        A dinosaur skeleton discovered by an eagle-eyed high-school student turns out to
                        be the smallest, youngest and most complete duck-billed dinosaur of its kind
                        ever found.

                    <p>
                        This Cretaceous-era herbivore, Parasaurolophus, walked the Earth some 75 million
                        years ago. The dinosaurs in this genus are best known for their impressive
                        tube-shaped head crests, which may have been used for display or perhaps to
                        amplify the animals' calls. The little specimen, dubbed "Joe," was so young that
                        its crest was a mere bump on its head.

                        Just two decades after first spotting planets orbiting a star other than our own
                        sun, astronomers have notched a big milestone — the 1,000th alien planet.

                        Two of the five main databases that catalog exoplanet discoveries list 1,010
                        confirmed alien worlds as of today (Oct. 23). That's a lot of progress since
                        1992, when researchers found the first-ever exoplanets orbiting a spinning
                        neutron star, or pulsar.

                        Finding a giant oarfish washed up on the beach is a rare occurrence, since the
                        fish is a deepwater species that's rarely seen at all. So when a second oarfish
                        was found just five days later, the rumor mill kicked into high gear.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An 18-foot-long (5.5 meters) oarfish carcass discovered on Oct. 13 was
                        considered a once-in-a-lifetime event for beachgoers on Catalina Island off the
                        coast of Southern California. But that event was followed five days later by a
                        second oarfish, measuring 14 feet (4.3 m), found on a beach in San Diego County.

                        How can you make roads safer for drivers? One company, known as Pro-Teq, is
                        testing glow-in-the-dark material that can be sprayed onto roadways to help
                        illuminate the way for night drivers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The U.K.-based company developed a waterproof photoluminescent coating, called
                        Starpath, which absorbs light during the day and gives off an ethereal glow at
                        night, according to Treehugger. The coating is non-reflective and has anti-slip
                        properties, which could reduce the number of accidents on motorways, reported
                        Treehugger. Starpath-covered roads could also help communities save money and
                        energy, since they are bright enough without street lamps.
